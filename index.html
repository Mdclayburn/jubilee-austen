                            <p> A little bit about me.
                                I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. 
                                As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. 
                                I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p></div>
                                <div class ="half-width"> <p> That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. 
                                    When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. 
                                    Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and 
                                    eye for detail to write clean, elegant code. </p> </div>

                        <h3><em>Hand Coded HTML</em></h3>
                        <p> My focus is creating aligned, easy to read, semantic HTML5 by hand
                            to ensure easy interaction for users, collaborators, and troubleshooting.</p>

                        <h3><em>Well organized CSS</em></h3>
                        <p> I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, 
                            and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices</p>
